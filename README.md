# CardioClarity: AI-powered ECG Anomaly Detection
## Overview

This project aims to detect anomalies in Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings using autoencoders, a type of neural network commonly employed for dimensionality reduction, image compression, and anomaly detection. An ECG is a diagnostic test that records the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time, helping to diagnose various heart conditions.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to identify irregular heart rates, heartbeats, and rhythms from ECG signals. This is accomplished through the utilization of autoencoders, which are trained on normal ECG patterns to learn the underlying structure of the data. Subsequently, deviations from this learned pattern can be flagged as anomalies.

## Methodology

Model Training: 
An autoencoder neural network is trained using normal ECG data. The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the input data with minimal loss, effectively learning a compressed representation of the normal ECG patterns.

Anomaly Detection: 
During inference, ECG signals are passed through the trained autoencoder. Deviations between the reconstructed signal and the original input signal are computed, with significant deviations indicative of anomalies.

## Key Features
Utilizes autoencoders for anomaly detection in ECG signals.

Provides a practical application of deep learning in healthcare, specifically in cardiovascular diagnostics.

Offers potential for early detection of heart abnormalities, leading to timely medical intervention.
